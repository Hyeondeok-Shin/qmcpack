This directory contains a limited number of examples of real-space QMC
and AFQMC calculations.

A large number of additional examples are provided in
qmcpack/nexus/examples. These include full workflows for molecular and
solid-state calculations including trial wavefunction generation with
Quantum ESPRESSO, GAMESS, PySCF, RMG DFT, and Quantum
Package. Examples are also given for the use of all estimators. In
many cases the workflows can be quickly adapted for research level
calculations.
